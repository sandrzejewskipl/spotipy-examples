# Spotipy Examples
A place to showcase the usage of spotipy. This repository consists in a set of examples into a Jupyter notebook to understand Spotipy functionalities.

## Quick Start
Once you have set up an environment for running Jupyter notebooks, run the [showcases notebook](https://github.com/spotipy-dev/spotipy-examples/blob/main/showcases.ipynb). 

Every snippet of code are independent from each other. However, you need to execute _Setup_ and _Credentials_ sections and insert the ID and SECRET key from your app in the  https://developers.spotify.com/ dashboard. 

For more info, check the [official documentation](https://spotipy.readthedocs.io/en/2.22.1/) or the [Github repository](https://github.com/spotipy-dev/spotipy).
